# CSCI2720_project

## AE Time
 - Build a web application for checking Hong Kong Emergency department waiting time. You can get the detail from **Project Document.pdf**.
 - This is a group project in CUHK course CSCI2720 (Building Web Applications). Alought it is a group project, i did almost 80~90% part since my poor groupmates have no idea how to handle react/nodeJS (or maybe they are busying in other stuff). Only 1 gpmate can help me code the hospital/user CRUD part. 

## Hosting
 - Link: https://csci-2720-project.vercel.app/
 - I hosted it on Amazon using aws serverless service with Vercel platform. At first I deploy it on google clould platform with docker file. Then I found that serverless is better since serverless are free forever.
 - Sometime it load a bit slow, that is because it need to create DB connection on every api request (cached already, but it can't last for long period).
 - It was quite fun to learn and deploy this project to serverless.
